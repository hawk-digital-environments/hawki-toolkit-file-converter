# v1.2.0

### What's New

- Adds a dedicated `/health` endpoint to the HAWKI File Converter API for monitoring service health and status. Especially in docker deployments, this endpoint can be used by orchestration tools to verify that the service is running correctly.

### Quality of Life

- Improves the automatic release pipeline to use the same pattern as HAWKI itself.
